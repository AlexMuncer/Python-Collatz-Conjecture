# Python-Collatz-Conjecture
This is a python program that represents the unsolved mathematical problem of the Collatz Conjecture.

Unsolved problem in mathematics: Does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values? The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.

this program includes basic error handling and asks the user for the positive integer in question.
